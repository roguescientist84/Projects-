This program pulsates a LED and then reads an input through the ADC that yields a 16 bit digital output on your computer.
I used photoresistors, but any analog transducer should work. 


You will need
1x 330 Ohm resistor, 1/4 Watt min 
1x LED
5x jumper wires (arduino type aka dupont connector)
1x or more photeresistors
1x Ambient light sensor. Optional. 


Also, if you do not already have them
Breadboard
Rasberry Pi Pico
USB micro to USB for the Pico
